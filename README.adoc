= Apache James Self Hosting Sandbox


A sample project to work on self hosting email server with Apache James.
It's meant to experiment and collaborate on stuff before pushing it upstream.

It's meant as an exercise and documentation.

Working on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JAMES-3209


== How to build and work with this repository

We use `gradle` to assemble Apache James libraries and configurations and produce a custom build James server.
We leverage Gradle's `application` plugin to assemble all of that into a binary archive that we can distribute.

We take the archive and build a docker image that we can deploy.

[source,bash]
--
    # Build the custom server - look under build/distributions/ for results.
    # Use --refresh-dependencies to force SNAPSHOT updates
    ./gradlew clean build
    # run via docker-compose
    docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
    # Run it from within gradle for local testing the configuration
    ./gradlew :james-server:run
--

== Running with docker-compose


The recommended way is to run with docker-compose.
The docker-compose configuration will build the james-server image for you.

[source, bash]
--
    # Build james-server-and-cli image and start the services
    docker-compose up --build -d
    # See the logs
    docker-compose logs -f

    # I usually combine them.
    # I add --build to force build the docker image.
    docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f

    # When done playing, remove all containers and data volumes
    docker-compose down -v
--


For completenes we will show how to also build the image with plain docker.

[source,bash]
--
    # Build the distributions
    ./gradlew clean build
    # Build the docker image
    docker build -t james-server-and-cli .
--

== Modules

The modules are meant to be kept independent.
They share the git repository.
They are aggregated via docker only.


james-server:: This module builds the email server application
james-cli:: This module builds the command line utility for using it with a server
james-extensions:: This module contains sample code on how to extend James server


=== James server

This module builds the email server.
It depends on the `james-extensions` gradle module so it will include all the customizations from there.
It uses gradle application plugin to package all java libraries into a `lib` directory.
The application plugin also provides nice linux and windows startup scripts that we can customize.


You can run james server locally via gradle (curtosy of application plugin)

[source,bash]
--
    # Run the server with
    ./gradlew clean build :james-server:runJamesServer
--

=== James Extensions

This module should contain code samples on how to extend Apache James.

We are talking about:
* a simple NoOP mailet
* a SMTP hook
* Mailbox Listener

The extensions module is built as a library and included in the final james-server application.

==== Mailets and matchers

Samples for mailets and matchers are in `ro.ieugen.sample.mailets` package.

The steps are as follows:

* Implement a matcher and/or a mailet class
* Add them to the classpath of james-server
* Configure them in mailetcontainer.xml

        class="ro.ieugen.sample.mailets.LogAndDoNothingMailet"/>
    </processor>

=== James CLI

This module provides the CLI for James server administration.
It is also built with the gradle application plugin and provides a bash script for calling it.

James CLI uses a JMX over HTTP connection to operate so it will need access to the administration port.
