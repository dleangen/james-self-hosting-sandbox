= Apache James Self Hosting Sandbox


A sample project to work on self hosting email server with Apache James.
It's meant to experiment and collaborate on stuff before pushing it upstream.

It's meant as an exercise and documentation.

Working on https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JAMES-3209


== How to build and work with this repository

We use `gradle` to assemble Apache James libraries and configurations and produce a custom build James server.
We leverage Gradle's `application` plugin to assemble all of that into a binary archive that we can distribute.

We take the archive and build a docker image that we can deploy.

[source,bash]
--
    # Build the custom server - look under build/distributions/ for results
    ./gradlew clean build
    # Unpack the distribution and run
    tar -xvf build/distributions/james-self-hosting-sandbox.tar
    cd james-self-hosting-sandbox
    # Run it
    ./bin/james-self-hosting-sandbox
